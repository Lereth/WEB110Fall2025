		<h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
		<p>Hi, I’m Ethan Schlereth — a near lifelong computer enthusiast with a deep interest in technology. I’m currently studying at Johnson County Community College, where I’m pursuing my Associate of Applied Science in Computer Support Specialist. So far, I’ve been excelling in the program with A’s and B’s and truly enjoying every part of it. After finishing my degree, I plan to earn my CompTIA A+ and Cisco CCNA certifications to further strengthen my skills in IT support and networking. I once began working toward a bachelor’s in Network Systems but decided to take time off to focus on my mental health — something that helped me grow and return to my studies with a clearer mindset and renewed motivation. Beyond my passion for computers, I also would in the future, enjoy learning about the trades specifically working with cars or air conditioners — I’ve always liked the idea of combining technical know-how with practical skills. When I’m not studying or working on computers, you’ll probably find me fishing, playing video games, or taking my dog to the park. I also love traveling with my dog and my significant other whenever I get the chance; those moments away help me recharge and stay grounded. My long-term dream is simple: to build a stable career, support my growing family, and eventually buy a small home of my own. Once I’m there, I’ll have time to worry about fixing the cars, and a little fishing with my dog and family wouldn't hurt.
